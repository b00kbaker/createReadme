## README Generator
  
  ## Description 
  
  *The what, why, and how:* 
   Simply answer a few questions detailing your current project and a ReadMe.md file will be automatically created with the up to date input. This generator makes use of basic Javascript skills, node.js, and the 'inquirer' package.

  
  *Instructions for use:*
   The User would simply need to open their intergrated terminal and type 'node index.js' into the command line to begin the list of prompts. Once the appropriate answer is typed out simply push 'enter' and continue through the entire list of queries. When everything is answered a success prompt will appear.
